SWIPE' pitch estimator, v. 1.0

Based on Camacho, Arturo. A sawtooth waveform inspired pitch estimator for 
speech and music. Doctoral dissertation, University of Florida. 2007. 

Implemented in C by Kyle Gorman <kgorman@ling.upenn.edu>

FOR ALL PLATFORMS:

To compile, type "make" at the terminal

To install, type "make install" at the terminal. You may specify '--prefix=PATH/TO/LOCATION' if you wish; the default is /usr/local
  
LINUX:

All the large libraries should be available as packages if you're using a 
"modern" distro. For instance, on a current Debian/Ubuntu system (Ubuntu 9.04, 
"Jaunty Jackalope", kernel 2.6.28-13-generic), I ran (as superuser):

apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev libfftw3-dev libsndfile1-dev

This installed the necessary libraries and all their dependencies.

MAC OS X:

The linear algebra libraries ([C]LAPACK, BLAS) ship with Mac OS X. You will need
to install the newest versions of fftw3 and libsndfile, however. They are 
available for free online:

http://www.fftw.org/
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

If you are superuser and wish to install globally the autoconf method should 
work fine:

tar -xvzf downloadedPackage.tar.gz
cd folderOfPackageCreatedByUnTARring/
./configure; make; make install;

If you're not superuser, or don't want to install globally, make sure to use 
'--prefix=PATH/TO/LOCATION' as an argument to 'configure'. You may need to alter
the #include statements as well. 

These two libraries are also available via fink or DarwinPorts.

WINDOWS/CYGWIN:

Unsupported. Send details of any successes, however.

PYTHON WRAPPER:

A Python wrapper is also available for this program: in addition to making a 
call to swipe and storing the results in a nice data structure, it also allows 
you to get the nearest pitch to a given time, slice the pitch space, and 
calculate the linear regression slope and R-squared. It requires a compiled 
version of swipe to be in your $PATH, of course.
